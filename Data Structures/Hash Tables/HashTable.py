"""Certainly! In simple terms, a hash table is a data structure that allows you to store and retrieve values based on
a unique key. It is like a dictionary or a phone book where you can look up information by using someone's name. The
key in a hash table plays a similar role to a name in a phone book.

Here's how a hash table works:

1. **Hashing**: When you want to store a value in a hash table, you provide a key-value pair. The hash table takes
the key and applies a special function called a hash function to it. The hash function converts the key into a unique
numeric value. Think of it as converting a name into a unique identifier.

2. **Indexing**: The hash value generated from the hash function is used as an index to determine where the value
will be stored in the hash table. Each index corresponds to a specific location in the table.

3. **Storage**: The value is stored at the calculated index in the hash table. If there are multiple values with the
same index (known as a collision), the hash table uses a technique like chaining or open addressing to handle it.
Chaining involves creating a linked list of values at each index, while open addressing explores alternative indices
to find an empty spot.

4. **Retrieval**: When you want to retrieve a value from the hash table, you provide the key again. The hash table
applies the same hash function to the key to calculate the corresponding index. It then goes to that index and
retrieves the value stored there.

The key advantage of a hash table is its efficiency in storing and retrieving values. It provides constant time
complexity (O(1)) for average case lookups, which means the time taken does not increase as the number of items
stored in the hash table increases.

In summary, a hash table is like a dictionary where you can store values and retrieve them quickly by using unique
keys. It uses a hash function to convert keys into indices for efficient storage and retrieval.

The hash function calculates a hash code from the key, and this hash code is used to determine the index where the
value will be stored in the hash table. So, the hash function itself does not directly calculate the index; it
generates a hash code that is then mapped to an index in the hash table.

Here's a step-by-step overview of how a hash table uses the hash function to determine the index:

The hash function takes the key as input and performs some computations on it. The hash function generates a hash
code, which is typically a numeric value. The hash code is then used to determine the index in the hash table. This
is done by applying a process called modulo division, where the hash code is divided by the size of the hash table (
the total number of available indices). The remainder of this division is the index where the value will be stored.

Advantages of Hash Tables:

Fast Lookup: Hash tables provide constant-time average case complexity (O(1)) for lookups, insertions, and deletions.
This makes them highly efficient for storing and retrieving data.

Flexible Key-Value Storage: Hash tables allow you to associate values with unique keys. This flexibility enables you
to store and retrieve data in a way that is easy to understand and maintain.

Efficient Memory Usage: Hash tables dynamically allocate memory based on the number of elements stored. This allows
for efficient memory usage because the size of the hash table adjusts dynamically to accommodate the number of entries.

Wide Range of Applications: Hash tables are used in various scenarios, including caching, symbol tables,
database indexing, language interpretation, and more. They provide an efficient way to handle large datasets and
enable quick access to information.

However, hash tables also have some disadvantages and considerations:

Disadvantages of Hash Tables:

Hash Collisions: Hash collisions occur when different keys generate the same hash code or index. Collisions can lead
to reduced performance as the hash table needs to handle and resolve them. Techniques like chaining or open
addressing are used to address collisions.

Space Overhead: Hash tables require additional memory to store the underlying data structure and handle collisions.
The space complexity can be higher than the actual number of elements stored, especially if collisions are frequent.

Ordering of Keys: Hash tables do not inherently preserve the order of keys. If the order of keys is important,
additional data structures may be required.

When to Use Hash Tables:

Hash tables are suitable when you need fast and efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions based on unique keys.
They are useful in scenarios where you have large datasets and need to quickly access and retrieve information. Hash
tables are valuable when you don't require a specific order for your data and the focus is on efficient retrieval
rather than maintaining a particular sequence. Applications that involve caching, symbol tables, database indexing,
or implementing lookup tables can benefit from using hash tables.
