"""
A priority queue is a type of queue that arranges elements based on their priority values. 
Elements with higher priority values are typically retrieved before elements with lower priority values.

In a priority queue, each element has a priority value associated with it. 
When you add an element to the queue, it is inserted in a position based on its priority value.
For example, if you add an element with a high priority value to a priority queue, 
it may be inserted near the front of the queue, while an element with a low priority value may be inserted near the back.
